# Icon Pack

A reusable Angular icon library for consumer applications. It exists to provide Material Design SVG icons with predictable rendering behavior and minimal consumer bundle size.

## Language

**Icon**:
A reusable visual symbol represented as SVG content.
_Avoid_: Glyph, asset

**Icon Component**:
A shallow Angular component that renders exactly one **Icon**.
_Avoid_: Smart component, container

**Consumer Application**:
An application that imports this library and uses its **Icon Components**.
_Avoid_: Host, client app

**Bundle-First Strategy**:
A delivery strategy where minimizing consumer JavaScript/CSS payload is prioritized over API convenience.
_Avoid_: Convenience-first

**Per-Icon Component API**:
A public API where each Icon is consumed through its own standalone Angular component.
_Avoid_: Dynamic name-based icon API

**Variant-Distinct Component Naming**:
A type-level naming contract where unfilled component classes use `Msr...IconComponent` and filled classes use `Msrf...IconComponent` to avoid import collisions.
_Avoid_: Cross-package class name collisions requiring consumer aliasing

**Material Symbols Rounded**:
The sole icon family included in v1 of the library.
_Avoid_: Mixed icon families in v1

**Normalized Symbol Variant**:
The fixed SVG variant profile used for every icon in v1: FILL=0, wght=400, GRAD=0, opsz=24.
_Avoid_: Per-icon variant proliferation in v1

**Filled Symbol Variant**:
A second fixed SVG profile for Material Symbols Rounded with FILL=1, wght=400, GRAD=0, opsz=24, intended for separate package distribution.
_Avoid_: Mixing filled and unfilled variants inside one component set

**Selector Naming Contract**:
A deterministic naming rule where each unfilled icon component selector is `msr-<kebab-icon-name>-icon`.
_Avoid_: Ad-hoc selector naming

**Filled Selector Naming Contract**:
A deterministic naming rule where each filled icon component selector is `msrf-<kebab-icon-name>-icon`.
_Avoid_: Selector collisions between variant packages

**Content-Sized Icon Defaults**:
A rendering contract where icon components behave like inline visual symbols by default, using `inline-flex`, `flex: 0 0 auto`, logical sizing (`inline-size`/`block-size`), and `currentColor` inheritance.
_Avoid_: Flex-grow-by-default icon hosts, parent-space-filling icon defaults, physical width/height for baseline sizing, dynamic style bindings for static icon layout rules, required consumer CSS imports for baseline rendering

**Variant Host Class Contract**:
A public styling contract where generated icon component hosts expose one stable variant-level CSS class that carries both variant identity and host layout through shared `.msr-icon` and `.msrf-icon` document styles injected once by the host directive, while allowing Consumer Applications to target the class for sizing, color, and contextual styling.
_Avoid_: Inner-SVG-only variant classes, per-icon CSS classes by default, separate shared host layout classes

**Variant SVG Class Contract**:
A public styling contract where generated icon SVG elements expose one stable variant-level CSS class that carries SVG layout and color inheritance through shared `.msr-icon-svg` and `.msrf-icon-svg` document styles.
_Avoid_: Unclassed inner SVG layout, shared cross-package SVG layout classes

**Pinned Sync Pipeline**:
A generation workflow where icons are synced from a pinned upstream reference via a dedicated script, and deterministic generated outputs are committed.
_Avoid_: Network-dependent build-time fetching

**Shared Upstream Pin**:
A synchronization policy where unfilled and filled package generations use the same upstream source ref.
_Avoid_: Variant drift caused by per-package source refs

**Variant Availability Tolerance**:
A generation policy where missing icons in one variant do not fail the sync; available icons are generated and missing ones are reported.
_Avoid_: Silent omission without visibility

**Upstream Availability Boundary**:
A consumer expectation policy where package maintainers only ship icons that exist upstream for the selected family/variant at the pinned ref, without guaranteeing parity beyond upstream availability.
_Avoid_: Treating the package as accountable for icons absent upstream

**Parameterized Generation Core**:
A single shared icon generation engine reused by multiple package targets via variant/package parameters, with thin target-specific commands.
_Avoid_: Duplicated per-package generation logic

**Full Upstream Inclusion**:
A scope rule where v1 includes every icon available in Material Symbols Rounded at the pinned upstream reference.
_Avoid_: Manual icon curation for v1

**Collision-Strict Generation**:
A generator policy that fails the sync process when naming collisions are detected, producing a collision report instead of auto-renaming.
_Avoid_: Silent renaming

**Icon SemVer Policy**:
A versioning rule where added icons are minor releases, removals/renames/rendering contract breaks are major releases, and non-API tooling fixes are patch releases.
_Avoid_: Unsignaled icon surface changes

**Lockstep Variant Versioning**:
A release policy where unfilled and filled packages share the same version number and are released together, including releases where only one package has icon-content diffs.
_Avoid_: Variant package version drift

**Single Entrypoint Imports**:
A consumer import policy where all icon components are imported from one root package entrypoint.
_Avoid_: Multiple consumer import patterns

**Compile-Time Icon Resolution**:
An icon delivery mode where all icon usage is resolved through static imports and build-time tree-shaking, with no runtime lazy icon fetching.
_Avoid_: Runtime icon loading in v1

**Decorative-First Accessibility**:
An accessibility contract where icons are `aria-hidden` by default and become labeled images only when an explicit `ariaLabel` is provided.
_Avoid_: Implicitly announced decorative icons

**Deterministic CI Baseline**:
A minimum quality gate that requires deterministic generation, successful production build, and a consumer smoke test for rendering and accessibility behavior.
_Avoid_: Build-only validation

**Library+Storybook Workspace**:
A workspace structure where publishable icon libraries and a Storybook-based non-publishable playground coexist, without a separate Angular demo application.
_Avoid_: Separate Angular demo application, library-only workspace in v1

**Shared Multi-Package Workspace**:
A repository topology where unfilled and filled icon packages are generated and published from the same workspace using shared generation logic.
_Avoid_: Variant packages maintained in separate repos with duplicated pipelines

**Variant Naming Alignment**:
A workspace naming rule where project name, dist path, package identity, selector prefix, and class prefix are consistently aligned per variant (e.g., `msr` vs `msrf`).
_Avoid_: Cross-layer naming mismatches requiring manual mapping

**Storybook Playground**:
A Storybook-based interactive surface used as the only demo/playground for validating icon rendering and usage patterns.
_Avoid_: Ad-hoc demo pages, separate Angular demo application as primary playground

**Storybook Host**:
The minimal Angular workspace target retained only to support Storybook's Angular integration.
_Avoid_: Demo application, product application

**Catalog Browser Story**:
A Storybook pattern where icon exploration is centralized in a searchable/filterable catalog story instead of per-icon stories.
_Avoid_: One-story-per-icon at v1 scale

**Dual-Package Distribution**:
A publishing model where the icon surface is released as two npm packages: unfilled and filled.
_Avoid_: Ambiguous or ad-hoc package splitting

**Manual-First Sync Governance**:
A release governance model where upstream icon synchronization is triggered explicitly by maintainers in v1, while keeping the pipeline automation-ready.
_Avoid_: Mandatory scheduled auto-sync in v1

**Traceable Upstream Compliance**:
A packaging requirement that ships upstream license attribution and generation provenance metadata, including the pinned source reference.
_Avoid_: Opaque generated provenance

**Authoritative Pinned Reference Disclosure**:
A documentation policy where each package README points to its pinned upstream source/ref as the authoritative availability source, optionally alongside the Google Icons browser URL.
_Avoid_: Treating mutable catalog pages as release authority

**Pure Entrypoint Contract**:
A packaging rule that keeps the root entrypoint side-effect-free and limited to static symbol re-exports to preserve tree-shaking.
_Avoid_: Executable barrel logic

**Embedded-SVG Distribution**:
A package output model where SVG markup is shipped only as embedded templates inside generated icon components, with no standalone SVG asset exports.
_Avoid_: Raw SVG artifact distribution

**Committed Generated Sources**:
A repository policy where generated icon components are checked into version control rather than produced only at publish time.
_Avoid_: Publish-only generation

**Package Identity**:
The published npm package name is `@captains-chest/material-symbols-rounded-icons`.
_Avoid_: Unscoped or generic package naming

**Filled Package Identity**:
The published npm package name for the filled variant is `@captains-chest/material-symbols-rounded-icons-filled`.
_Avoid_: Ambiguous naming between variant packages

**Standalone-Only Delivery**:
A framework contract where all icon components are published as Angular standalone components with no NgModule wrapper API.
_Avoid_: Dual standalone/NgModule surfaces in v1

## Flagged ambiguities

- "all icons available" could mean "all icons published" or "all icons bundled into every app" — resolved: all icons should be published, but only used icons should be bundled in a **Consumer Application**.
- "shallow components" was ambiguous — resolved: use a **Per-Icon Component API** backed by shared rendering behavior, with no icon-specific business logic.
- "all Material icons" was ambiguous — resolved: v1 scope is only **Material Symbols Rounded**.
- "all variants" was ambiguous — resolved: v1 ships one **Normalized Symbol Variant** only.
- "the filled" was ambiguous — resolved as a distinct **Filled Symbol Variant** (FILL=1, wght=400, GRAD=0, opsz=24) intended to ship as its own package.
- Component naming was unspecified — resolved with a strict **Selector Naming Contract** using the `msr-<kebab-icon-name>-icon` pattern.
- Filled selector naming was unspecified — resolved with a strict **Filled Selector Naming Contract** using the `msrf-<kebab-icon-name>-icon` pattern to prevent dual-package collisions.
- Cross-package TypeScript class naming was unspecified — resolved with **Variant-Distinct Component Naming** (`Msr...` vs `Msrf...`).
- Brand prefix choice was unspecified — resolved to `msr-` for selector alignment.
- Icon layout default was unclear — initially resolved as **Container-Driven Sizing** (parent controls size; icon grows by default), then superseded by **Content-Sized Icon Defaults** after flex-parent layout issues.
- Flex behavior details were unspecified — resolved with an explicit host/SVG CSS contract.
- Flex-grow-by-default caused icons inside `justify-content: space-between` flex parents to absorb extra width — resolved by replacing **Container-Driven Sizing** with **Content-Sized Icon Defaults** (`inline-flex`, `flex: 0 0 auto`, `1em` square by default).
- SVG sizing property choice was unspecified — resolved that host and inner SVG baseline sizing use logical properties (`inline-size` and `block-size`) consistently.
- Host display mode was unspecified — resolved to `inline-flex` rather than `inline-block` to preserve the host-as-flex-container shape without flex-grow behavior.
- Static layout styling mechanism was unspecified — resolved that fixed icon layout rules should consume package-owned CSS classes instead of Angular style bindings, reserving dynamic bindings for genuinely dynamic values.
- CSS rule ownership was unspecified — resolved that shared directives apply public classes only, while package-owned stylesheets own the corresponding rules.
- Stylesheet delivery was unspecified — resolved that baseline icon styles are auto-included by Angular component metadata rather than requiring Consumer Applications to import package CSS.
- Component style placement was unspecified — resolved that each generated icon component carries identical variant-specific `styles` metadata for its host and inner SVG classes.
- Component style selector shape was unspecified — resolved that host rules use `:host.<variant-class>` while inner SVG rules use plain variant SVG class selectors.
- Consumer override expectations were unspecified — resolved that public variant classes are intended for consumer sizing, color, and contextual styling, while overriding baseline rendering properties may require more specific CSS.
- Release impact was unspecified — resolved that adding public variant CSS classes is a minor release, while future removal or renaming is a major release.
- Default sizing release impact was unspecified — resolved that changing from flex-grow/container-filling defaults to **Content-Sized Icon Defaults** is a major rendering-contract change, with documented CSS recipes for opting back into container-filling behavior.
- Container-filling opt-in API was unspecified — resolved that opt-in should be consumer CSS using existing public variant classes, not new built-in fill utility classes.
- CSS class placement was unspecified — resolved with **Variant Host Class Contract** on component hosts only, using variant-level classes rather than per-icon classes by default.
- CSS class stability was unspecified — resolved that **Variant Host Class Contract** is public styling API, so removing or renaming these classes is a breaking rendering contract change.
- Host class responsibility was unspecified — resolved that variant host classes carry both variant identity and host layout, avoiding separate shared host layout classes.
- SVG class responsibility was unspecified — resolved with **Variant SVG Class Contract**, using variant-specific SVG classes applied by shared SVG directives.
- Upstream ingestion strategy was unspecified — resolved with a **Pinned Sync Pipeline** (sync script + committed generated outputs).
- Cross-package generation strategy was unspecified — resolved with a **Parameterized Generation Core** plus thin per-package commands.
- Variant source-ref coordination was unspecified — resolved with a **Shared Upstream Pin**.
- Missing-icon behavior across variants was unspecified — resolved with **Variant Availability Tolerance** (continue generation + report gaps).
- Accountability for missing icons was unspecified — resolved with an **Upstream Availability Boundary** (ship what exists upstream at pinned ref; no maintainer guarantee beyond that).
- "all icons" inclusion policy was unclear — resolved as **Full Upstream Inclusion** for v1.
- Naming collision handling was unspecified — resolved with **Collision-Strict Generation** (fail fast + report).
- Version bump behavior for upstream icon changes was unspecified — resolved with an explicit **Icon SemVer Policy**.
- Multi-package version coordination was unspecified — resolved with **Lockstep Variant Versioning**.
- Behavior when only one package has content changes was unspecified — resolved by still releasing both packages under lockstep.

- Runtime loading expectations were unspecified — resolved to **Compile-Time Icon Resolution** for v1.
- Accessibility behavior was unspecified — resolved with **Decorative-First Accessibility**.
- CI quality expectations were vague — resolved with a **Deterministic CI Baseline**.
- Repository shape was undecided — resolved to a **Library+Storybook Workspace**.
- The role of the Angular demo application was unclear — resolved: Storybook is the only playground surface, so the separate demo application should be removed.
- Variant repo topology was undecided — resolved to a **Shared Multi-Package Workspace**.
- Cross-layer naming for the filled variant was unspecified — resolved with **Variant Naming Alignment**.
- Playground technology was unspecified — resolved to a **Storybook Playground**.
